<h3>Medical Image Computing & Machine Learning</h3>
<table class="citations">
    <p>
        We develop computational, mathematical and engineering methods to extract and analyze clinically relevant information from biomedical images to advance our understanding of medical conditions and aid in their diagnosis and treatment to improve patient care. These techniques address problems such as image segmentation, registration and classification and often involve data-driven approaches, machine learning methods and convolutional neural networks. Some selected publications are:

<h3>Human-Centered Design & Clinical Translation</h3>
<table class="citations">
    <p>We draw on human-centered computing approaches to develop systems for the translation of imaging-based machine-learning and AI approaches into clinical settings.  Specifically, we design, develop, and evaluate systems that embed outcomes of prediction models and AI-based computations in accessible user interfaces so that they can then be integrated into existing clinical workflows. In addition, we develop methods that utilize visual representations to explain predictions to clinicians. We have created computational infrastructure to facilitate the design and development of such systems and for running realistic user studies to evaluate the systems. Current biomedical applications include the clinical translation of automated landmarking for 3D photograms for assessing craniosynostosis, and studying the impact of AI-based decision support on clinical experts' radiographic interpretation of a pediatric brain tumor, adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Some of our human-centered design and clinical translation publications are:</p>

<h3>Clinical & Radiological research</h3>
<table class="citations">
    <p>We advance breast imaging through artificial intelligence (AI), operational improvements, and health equity initiatives.  We aim to enhance mammographic interpretation by developing deep-learning models that reduce false negatives and improve risk stratification. By integrating AI-driven predictive tools, we seek to personalize breast cancer screening, ensuring that high-risk patients receive appropriate imaging and follow-up. We also focus on optimizing operational efficiency in breast imaging, evaluating initiatives that reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.<br>
    In addition, we address disparities in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. We have previously investigated barriers to imaging access among underserved populations, with an emphasis on patient-provider communication and health literacy.  Our work includes designing more effective patient education materials and improving online access to radiology reports. By combining innovation with a commitment to health equity, our research aims to transform breast imaging practices and improve early cancer detection for all populations.
